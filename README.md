# PostgreSQL CRUD Practice â€“ Employee Management System

This project is a hands-on SQL exercise focused on mastering core database concepts using PostgreSQL. It includes the creation and manipulation of a simplified Employee Management System with realistic data and relationships.

## Overview

The SQL script includes:

- Creation of relational tables:
  - `cities`
  - `addresses`
  - `departments`
  - `employees`
  - `projects`
  - `employees_projects`
- Data population using `INSERT INTO` with realistic values
- Key constraints and validation with `CHECK`, `NOT NULL`, and `FOREIGN KEY` logic
- Practical CRUD operations:
  - `SELECT` queries with sorting and filtering
  - `INSERT` to add a new employee
  - `UPDATE` to change salary and title
  - `DELETE` to remove a record
  - `TRUNCATE` and `DROP TABLE` for cleanup

## Skills Practiced

- Table creation and data modeling
- Writing and executing SQL CRUD operations
- Applying data constraints and validations
- Understanding table relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many)
- Querying with filters, sorting, and joins (if needed in future expansion)

## Tools

- PostgreSQL
- pgAdmin (used for executing queries)

## Notes

This lab was completed as part of my personal development and practice in relational databases. The dataset is large and simulates real-world structure for HR and project tracking systems.
